In order to run this project, we'll need the Python NAOqi SDK.
If you want to test, you will also need Choreagraphe.

Download and complete the installation instructions located [here](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-1/dev/python/install_guide.html)

We don't really have the actual infrastructure set up for things to move yet.
